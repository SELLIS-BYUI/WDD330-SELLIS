    <h1>Week 08 Notes</h1>
    <p>Week 08 notes - This week we covered a lot of CSS3 such as animations, transforms, translations<br>
        and other tools to change our CSS. The one important thing that I learned overall from the reading<br>
        is that there are good ways but there are also better ways. Example there are older CSS styles or<br> 
        CSS but there are other new ways or shortcuts. But these few sections were very helpful in the<br> 
        reading,<br> 
        
        "Note that you shouldnâ€™t declare a new transform : because of the cascade, a second transform<br> 
        would override the first. To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of<br> 
        transform functions. We simply add our scale to the end of that space-separated list...The order<br> 
        of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction<br> 
        will be on the rotated axis. The rightmost square in Figure 8.8 was translated then rotated with<br> 
        transform: translateX(200px) rotate(135deg); . The leftmost square was rotated first then translated<br> 
        along the newly rotated axis: transform: rotate(135deg) translateX(200px)...The transition-property<br> 
        property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all<br> 
        properties being the default...You can provide any number of CSS properties to the transition-property<br> 
        declaration, separated by commas. Alternatively, you can use the keyword all to indicate that every<br> 
        supported property should be animated as it transitions" (HTML5 & CSS3 for the Real World: 2nd Edition).<br>
        
        Code Example:<br>
        
        There was not any code examples for this week but my notes and sections of readings I marked. Beacuse<br> 
        they are very helpful to me and will be in the future.</p>
