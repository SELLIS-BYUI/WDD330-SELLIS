        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p> "A warning can occur if thereâ€™s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program<br>
            to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. This might sound good,<br>
            but it can be problematic, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to<br>
            continue running incorrectly... One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will<br>
            create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where<br> 
            the program is currently up to. You can also hover over any variables to see what value they hold at<br> 
            that point. The program can then be restarted by clicking on the 'play' button."<br> 
            (JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition).</p><br>

            Warnings do not always make the program crash. So you don't always have to fix them if it is not<br>
            required. But is a good note to make aware of for your team or your future updates or changes.<br>
            Debugging tools can help to solve or find bugs in the code. Some of those tools are listed below:<br>
            These browsers have their own debugging documentation FireFox, Edge, Google Chrome, Safari.<br>

        <h3>Code examples:</h3>
        <p>pi = 3.142;
            << JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared variable
        </p><br>
