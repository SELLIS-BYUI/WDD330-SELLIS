<p>There are global variables for the can be used to get access to entire program.
However there are better and worst ways/times to do this because it sometimes
raises a risk. A risk of causing errors in our programs. Global variables are
part of properties on the global object aka the window object.<br>

"In general, you should refer to global variables without using the window object;
it’s less typing and your code will be more portable between environments. An exception is 
if you need to check whether a global variable has been defined. For example, the 
following code will throw a ReferenceError if x has not been defined" (JavaScript:
Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition).<br>

popup in windows is ok but from over the years they have gotten a bad name or a 
bad rep. Because of the popup method a lot of browsers now a days<br> 

"disallow some
of these methods to be called in certain cases. For example, you can’t resize a
window if more than one tab is open. You also can’t move or resize a window that 
wasn’t created using window.open(). It’s rare that it would be sensible to use 
any of these methods, so think very carefully before using them. There will almost
always be a better alternative, and a ninja programmer will endeavor to find it"
(JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition).<br>

Everyone windows object has a document object that is which is where DOM comes in. 
Because it allows us to use certain properties and methods to create, manipulate, and
change HTML. Giving us the ability to dynamically create tags, attributes, and etc.</p>
