<p>There are global variables for the can be used to get access to entire program.<br>
However there are better and worst ways/times to do this because it sometimes<br>
raises a risk. A risk of causing errors in our programs. Global variables are<br>
part of properties on the global object aka the window object.<br><br> 

"In general, you should refer to global variables without using the window object;<br> 
it’s less typing and your code will be more portable between environments. An exception is<br> 
if you need to check whether a global variable has been defined. For example, the<br> 
following code will throw a ReferenceError if x has not been defined" (JavaScript:<br> 
Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition).<br><br>

popup in windows is ok but from over the years they have gotten a bad name or a<br> 
bad rep. Because of the popup method a lot of browsers now a days<br><br> 

"disallow some
of these methods to be called in certain cases. For example, you can’t resize a<br> 
window if more than one tab is open. You also can’t move or resize a window that<br> 
wasn’t created using window.open(). It’s rare that it would be sensible to use<br> 
any of these methods, so think very carefully before using them. There will almost<br> 
always be a better alternative, and a ninja programmer will endeavor to find it"<br> 
(JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition).<br><br>

Everyone windows object has a document object that is which is where DOM comes in.<br> 
Because it allows us to use certain properties and methods to create, manipulate, and<br> 
change HTML. Giving us the ability to dynamically create tags, attributes, and etc.</p>
