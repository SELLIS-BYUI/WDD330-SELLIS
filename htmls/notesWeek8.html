    <h2>Week 08 Notes</h2>
    <p>Week 08 notes - This week we covered a lot of CSS3 such as animations, transforms, translations
        and other tools to change our CSS. The one important thing that I learned overall from the reading
        is that there are good ways but there are also better ways. Example there are older CSS styles or
        CSS but there are other new ways or shortcuts. But these few sections were very helpful in the
        reading,<br> 
        
        "Note that you shouldnâ€™t declare a new transform : because of the cascade, a second transform
        would override the first. To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of
        transform functions. We simply add our scale to the end of that space-separated list...The order
        of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction
        will be on the rotated axis. The rightmost square in Figure 8.8 was translated then rotated with 
        transform: translateX(200px) rotate(135deg); . The leftmost square was rotated first then translated
        along the newly rotated axis: transform: rotate(135deg) translateX(200px)...The transition-property
        property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all
        properties being the default...You can provide any number of CSS properties to the transition-property
        declaration, separated by commas. Alternatively, you can use the keyword all to indicate that every
        supported property should be animated as it transitions" (HTML5 & CSS3 for the Real World: 2nd Edition).
        
        <h2>Code Example:</h2>
        
        There was not any code examples for this week but my notes and sections of readings I marked. Beacuse<br> 
        they are very helpful to me and will be in the future.</p>
