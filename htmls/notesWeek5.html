        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p> "A warning can occur if thereâ€™s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program
            to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. This might sound good,
            but it can be problematic, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to
            continue running incorrectly... One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will
            create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where
            the program is currently up to. You can also hover over any variables to see what value they hold at 
            that point. The program can then be restarted by clicking on the 'play' button."
            (JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition).</p><br>

            Warnings do not always make the program crash. So you don't always have to fix them if it is not
            required. But is a good note to make aware of for your team or your future updates or changes.
            Debugging tools can help to solve or find bugs in the code. Some of those tools are listed below:
            These browsers have their own debugging documentation FireFox, Edge, Google Chrome, Safari.<br>
