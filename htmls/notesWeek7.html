        <p>Dealing With A Settled Promise<br>
          Once a promise has been settled, the then() method can be used to deal with the outcome.<br> 
          This method accepts two arguments. The first is afulfilment functionthat’s called when<br> 
          the promise is resolved. Any data returned from the resolve() function will be passed<br> 
          along to this function. The second argument is a rejection function that’s called if<br> 
          the promise is rejected. Similar to the fulfilment function, the rejection function<br> 
          receives any data returned from the reject() function.</p>
          <h2>Code sample</h2>
          <p>
            romise.then( result => console.log(`I rolled a ${result}`) )
                .catch( result => console.log(`Drat! ... I rolled a ${result}`) );
