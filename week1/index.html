        <p>Master Mobile UX svideo – Three things that help with getting inside user’s heads<br>
            when trying to design mobile websites:- Be there, be useful, be quick.Remember<br> 
            that it is better to plan a website using mobile app design. Then we can expand<br> 
            on this to other larger devices so that we can keep users. But there are other<br> 
            important things that need to happen such the website needs to be reachable, menu<br> 
            needs to be well placed, and faster. The history of mobile compare to pc or desktop<br> 
            is interesting since the mobile has continued to increase. But mobile is having ben<br> 
            able to increase at a high rate and it will continue to increase because of how mobile<br> 
            devices can go everywhere.Start small and scale up think phone to monitor rather than<br> 
            the other way around. Not only does out websites for site need to be well designed but<br> 
            they need to be fast. How this can be done is by, reducing image usage throughout site/<br> 
            app, SVG/Web fronts are lower bandwidth, Optimize CSS and JS files, GZIP files to<br> 
            eliminate unnecessary data.Reachability, Speed and Network, all of things matter in<br> 
            order to make the sites more pleasing to users and will keep them. </p>
